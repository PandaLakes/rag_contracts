# Project Description

This project automates the process of generating contracts using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The system extracts relevant data from contract PDFs and augments it with user-specific information, such as email content, to generate customized contracts. The RAG approach ensures precision and adaptability in contract creation.

Initially, this project was designed to be integrated with AI agents. These agents would manage tasks such as retrieving business emails, extracting key information, and autonomously generating contracts. Future plans include expanding the project to incorporate these AI agents for a fully automated, end-to-end contract generation workflow.
